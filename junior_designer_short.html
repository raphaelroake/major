         <p> 
            <h8>Interviewer</h8>: I was wondering how you navigate, if you do, 
            ethics 
            within your work?
           
           
 <span class="indent"> 
     <br>
<h8>Roydon Misseldine</h8>: I guess ethics is an interesting one because 
     <br>generally you’re getting hired to do a particular job and they expect a certain outcome. So if there’s certain ethics along the way that you find that don’t align with what you’re about, and your own vision or the company's vision that you’re working with, I kinda think that it’s up to you to convince that client that there’s a better way of doing this through design. If it’s a particular medium that’s unethical whether it be a t-shirt that gets made in a certain area, then I think because you’re in on that project. Now it’s up to you to voice your own opinions to the client or whoevers higher up and say ‘hey we can get some organic t-shirts and this is how we can make it happen.’ And put in that kinda extra effort to make that happen. Sometimes that may not work but it kinda comes down to putting in that extra work to make those conscious decisions around ethics.
            </span>
<br>
            <span class="indent"> 
                <h8>I</h8>: I think that’s a really proactive way of looking at it!
            </span>
<br>
<span>
<span class="indent"> 
    <h8>RM</h8>: There’s obviously a scale of ethics. There are small things that might be unethical and very large things. There’s kinda like a two way street sometimes. You might find that the door to bad ethics is really easy to go through, because it’s the easy route and the good ethics is the hard route. It actually takes a bit of effort from yourself to go down that good route. So the doors are kinda black and white right? And it’s very easy to keep going down the bad ethics route with these decisions so i think its kinda up to (if you’re a designer) try and persevere and take the good ethics route. I mean that could be a decision between the materials you’re using, where the typeface has come from, whatever the hell that (decision) is. It’s little decisions that make up a bigger picture in what we do. There’s tons of different examples from those things. So I kinda see it as two doors, in all those opportunities, taking the route to good ethics. Because that’s generally the harder one.
            </span>      
            </span>
<br>
<span class="indent">             
<h8>I</h8>: That’s a dope way to think about it.
            </span>           
<br>

<span class="indent"> 
    <h8>RM</h8>: Yeah that’s kinda how I interpret it. Obviously it’s not always in your control and there’s kinda a battle there and I think that when it does get bad, and it never really does, but if it does, then there’s decisions you can make if you’re working on a project within yourself like, ‘am I doing the right thing here?’ But I mean from my experience it doesn’t get to those kind of extremes. It’s all the little things, all those little decisions. It could be the bloody colour of it, and how does that influence a certain area or if it’s going up in a certain place. 
            </span>
            
<br>
            
            <span class="indent">
                <h8>I</h8>: Do you think that most people that you’ve come across in industry are conscious of this? Do they practice it? </span>

<br>
            <span class="indent"> 
<h8>RM</h8>: I think it’s a subconscious right? If you’ve been brought up with ethics in place and strong emphasis on good ethics, then your gonna consciously make decisions that go through that white door without even thinking about it. But there’s obviously going to be times where you’re presented with a huge black door and there’s only a really small white door. You may need to go through that black door and through that black door there are going to be other situations where you can make better decisions in an ethical way. I guess everyone’s kinda different and everyone approaches it differently. I think there’s various people in positions of power who make good ethical decisions around employees and their business and how they run that. So from my point of view i’m not in that position of power with a lot of the projects that come across my desk. So it’s up to people in that power, to convince others and to take lead.
